# setupmc.com issue tracker
Found a problem or want a new feature for [setupmc.com](https://setupmc.com)? [Create an issue here!](https://github.com/Krymonota/setupmc-issues/issues)

## What belongs here?

Please note that this issue tracker is specific to the website. This means that you should only create an issue if you have a problem using the website, are missing an option supported by the Docker image `itzg/minecraft-docker-server`, or if you want to suggest better descriptions or troubleshooting hints for other users. Other issues probably belong in the [issue tracker of the Docker image](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/issues). If you are not sure where to create the issue, create it here and we will direct you to the other issue tracker if there is nothing we can do.

## Where can I get help?

Detailed explanations of the individual options and further customization options can be found in the [official documentation](https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
You can get help setting up and customizing your server in the [Discord community of itzg](https://discord.gg/DXfKpjB), the creator of Minecraft Server on Docker.

## Is the website open-source?

No, at the moment the website is not open source.

## Can I support you?

Rather consider [sponsoring itzg](https://github.com/sponsors/itzg) who created and maintains the Docker image.
